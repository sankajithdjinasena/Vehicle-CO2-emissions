# 🚗 Vehicle CO₂ Emissions Analysis

### *Regression Modeling \| Machine Learning \| EDA*

This repository contains a complete machine learning workflow built
using the **Vehicle CO₂ Emissions Dataset**, which includes vehicle
specifications, fuel consumption metrics, and CO₂ emission rates. The
project demonstrates how vehicle attributes influence emissions and how
regression models can be used to predict CO₂ output.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle:

Vehicle CO2 Emissions Dataset\
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsahan/vehicle-co2-emissions-dataset/

It includes key features such as: - Brand - Vehicle Type - Engine Size
(L) - Cylinders - Transmission Type - Fuel Type - Fuel Consumption
(City, Hwy, Combined) - CO₂ Emissions (g/km)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

-   Analyze relationships between vehicle specs and CO₂ emissions\
-   Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
-   Build Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models\
-   Visualize trends affecting environmental impact

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Python, Pandas, NumPy\
-   Matplotlib, Seaborn\
-   Scikit-learn\
-   Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Includes: - Data cleaning\
- Missing value checks\
- Distribution plots\
- Correlation heatmap\
- Boxplots & scatter plots

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

Predicts CO₂ emissions using Engine Size (L).

### Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

Uses: - Engine Size\
- Cylinders\
- Fuel Consumption\
- Encoded Transmission & Fuel Type
